# Epic Games Username Generator
You can get whatever name you want with this generator, which works with unicode character combinations. It gives you options so you can check all of them, if one of them is valid, you can use it however you want. Even with that, you can connect that to your Discord account.

## How to install/use it
- Firstly, you need to install nodejs to use this.
- After installing nodejs, write these commands in your fav terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/byigitt/epicgames-name-generator.git
cd epicgames-name-generator && node .
```

## How does it work?
Epic Games allows users to get their username with alike unicode letters, so we create combinations to use them in your username. You will not notice any differences between normal latin letters, because they look alike.
